# Classical Music Generation with RNN

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating classical music. The code provided here demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to compose classical music pieces.

The motivation for this project arose from an assignment in a university course on Artificial Intelligence. Please note that the content within the notebook is written in Spanish.
